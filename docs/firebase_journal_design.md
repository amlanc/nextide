# Firebase Journal Application with NextIDE Symbolic AI

## Overview
This document describes how NextIDE's symbolic AI components would validate and correct a Firebase journal application that:
- Implements Google authentication
- Stores user profiles (name, address, phone)
- Allows users to create journal entries

## 1. Symbolic Governors Application

### 1.1 Architecture Governor (ASP-based)
The architecture governor would enforce proper separation of concerns:

```prolog
% Rule: UI components cannot access Firebase directly
invalid_architecture :-
    component(X, presentation),
    component(Y, data),
    direct_dependency(X, Y).

% Rule: Firebase operations must use service abstractions
missing_service_layer :-
    firebase_operation(X),
    not through_service(X).
```

This governor would detect issues like:
- React components directly calling Firestore
- Authentication logic embedded in UI components
- Missing service layer abstractions

### 1.2 Type Checker (Z3-based)
The type checker would verify data models:

```python
def verify_firebase_types(ast):
    solver = z3.Solver()

    # Define Profile type constraints
    profile_constraints = z3.And(
        has_property("userId", StringType),
        has_property("name", StringType),
        has_property("address", StringType),
        has_property("phone", StringType)
    )

    # Define Journal entry constraints
    journal_constraints = z3.And(
        has_property("id", StringType),
        has_property("userId", StringType),
        has_property("title", StringType),
        has_property("content", StringType),
        has_property("createdAt", TimestampType)
    )

    # Add constraints from code
    solver.add(profile_constraints)
    solver.add(journal_constraints)

    return solver.check()
```

This governor would detect issues like:
- Missing type definitions
- Inconsistent data models
- Type mismatches in Firebase operations

### 1.3 Best Practices Governor (Prolog-based)
The best practices governor would verify coding standards:

```prolog
% Rule: Firebase operations need error handling
missing_error_handling(Op) :-
    firebase_operation(Op),
    not has_try_catch(Op).

% Rule: Firestore writes need validation
missing_validation(Write) :-
    firestore_write(Write),
    not has_validation_before_write(Write).
```

This governor would detect issues like:
- Missing error handling in auth flows
- Lack of data validation
- Inefficient query patterns

### 1.4 Security Governor (CLIPS-based)
The security governor would verify security practices:

```clips
(defrule missing-auth-check
    (firebase-operation (type read-write) (has-auth-check no))
    =>
    (assert (security-violation "Missing authentication check")))

(defrule missing-user-isolation
    (firestore-collection (name ?name) (has-user-isolation no))
    =>
    (assert (security-violation "Missing user data isolation")))
```

This governor would detect issues like:
- Missing authentication checks
- Improper data access controls
- Insecure Firebase rules

## 2. Orchestration Pipeline

The orchestration pipeline would validate and correct Firebase code:

```python
async def generate_and_verify(self, request):
    # 1. Generate initial code with LLM
    code = await self.llm.generate_code(request.prompt)

    # 2. Iterative verification and correction
    for i in range(5):  # Max 5 iterations
        # Verify with all governors
        arch_result = self.arch_governor.verify(code)
        type_result = self.type_checker.verify(code)
        bp_result = self.best_practices.verify(code)
        sec_result = self.security_checker.verify(code)

        # Calculate compliance percentage
        results = [arch_result, type_result, bp_result, sec_result]
        compliance = self._calculate_compliance(results)

        # Exit if compliance target reached
        if compliance >= 0.9:  # 90% target
            break

        # Generate corrections based on violations
        corrections = self.correction_engine.generate(code, results)

        # Apply corrections with LLM
        code = await self.llm.apply_corrections(code, corrections)

    return code, compliance, results
```

## 3. Example Iterations

### Iteration 1: Initial Generation
LLM generates code for Firebase journal app, but symbolic governors detect:
- UI components directly accessing Firestore
- Incomplete TypeScript interfaces
- Missing error handling
- No security rules

### Iteration 2: First Correction
Correction engine generates prompts to fix issues:
- "Move Firebase operations to service layer"
- "Complete TypeScript interfaces for models"
- "Add error handling to auth operations"
- "Implement Firebase security rules"

LLM applies corrections, but new issues emerge:
- Service layer structure improved but not complete
- Type definitions fixed
- Some error handling added but inconsistent
- Basic security rules added

### Iteration 3: Second Correction
Further corrections focus on:
- "Complete service abstraction for all Firebase operations"
- "Standardize error handling across services"
- "Enhance security rules with user isolation"

Final code achieves >90% compliance with all symbolic governors.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1. Define Firebase-specific rules for each governor
2. Create specialized correction templates for Firebase patterns
3. Implement verification pipeline with the four governors
4. Test with sample Firebase journal app requirements
5. Refine governors based on feedback loop
